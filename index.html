      <section>
        <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>
          The information collected is used solely for the purpose of providing the note-taking
          functionality of the extension. Specifically:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Profile usernames are used to associate your notes with specific X profiles.</li>
          <li>
            Web history and user activity data are used to determine when to display the note-taking
            interface.
          </li>
          <li>
            Website content is accessed to integrate the note-taking functionality with X profile
            pages.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>4. Data Storage</h2>
        <p>
          All notes and associated data are stored locally on your device using the browser's
          IndexedDB. We do not transmit or store your data on external servers.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>
          We do not share any of the collected information with third parties. All data remains on
          your local device.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>
          You have the right to access, modify, or delete any notes you've created using the
          extension. This can be done directly through the extension's interface on X profile pages.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>7. Security</h2>
        <p>
          We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the information
          collected and stored by the extension. However, as the data is stored locally on your
          device, the security of your information also depends on your personal device security.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
